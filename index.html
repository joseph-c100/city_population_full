                <h1>The Changing Faces of City Populations</h1>
                <h4>More than half the world now live in cities.</h4>
                <p> For most of human history, most people across the world lived in small communities. 
                    Over the past few centuries – and particularly in recent decades – this has shifted dramatically. 
                    There has been a mass migration of populations from rural to urban areas.

                    Rural population refers to people living in rural areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated as the difference between total population and urban population.

                <p>
                    Increasingly more and more people are moving to cities. The UN estimates this milestone event – when the number of people in urban areas overtook the number in rural settings – occurred in 2007.
